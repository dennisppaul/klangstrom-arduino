# Klangstrom_KLST_PANDA_STM32_CubeMX

This is the board-specific part of the auto-generated Klangstrom library for the KLST_PANDA board running on STM32. All source files in this directory are generated by STM32CubeMX in the `klangstrom-stm32` library and should only be modified in `klangstrom-stm32`. The files in this library are only necessary for use in the Arduino IDE.
